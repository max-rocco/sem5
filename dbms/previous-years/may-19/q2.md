### Q2a. Explain the following Relational Algebra operations with suitable example.

→ The following table will be used in the examples.

| CustomerID | CustomerName | Status   |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| 1          | Google       | Active   |
| 2          | Amazon       | Active   |
| 3          | Apple        | Inactive |
| 4          | Alibaba      | Active   |

#### a. Projection (π)

→ Projection eliminates all but those mentioned in the projection list. 
The projection method defines a relation that contains a vertical subset of relation.

→ This helps to extract the values of specified attributes to eliminate duplicate values.

→ π (pi) is used to choose attributes from a relation. 
This operator helps you keep specific columns from a relation and discard other columns.

```
π CustomerName, Status (Customers)
```

→ Here, the projection of CustomerName & Status will give the following result.

| CustomerName | Status   |
|--------------|----------|
| Google       | Active   |
| Amazon       | Active   |
| Apple        | Inactive |
| Alibaba      | Active   |

#### b. Select (σ)

→ The SELECT operation is used for selecting a subset of the tuples according to a given 
selection condition. 

→ σ (Sigma) symbol is used to denote this relation.
It is used as an expression to choose tuples which meet the selection condition.
Select operator selects tuples that satisfy a given predicate.

```
σ CustomerName = "Amazon" and Status = "Active"
```

→ Here, the selection of `CustomerName = "Amazon"` & `Status = "Active"` will give the following 
result.

| CustomerName | Status   |
|--------------|----------|
| Amazon       | Active   |

#### c. Union (∪)

→ This is a binary operation & will include all the tuples from both the tables.
It also eliminates duplicate tuples.

→ For a union operation to be valid, the following conditions must hold:

* Both tables must have the same number of attributes.
* Attribute domains need to be compatible.
* Duplicate tuples should be automatically removed.

| Table A  |          |   | Table B  |          |
|----------|----------|---|----------|----------|
| column 1 | column 2 |   | column 1 | column 2 |
| 1        | 1        |   | 1        | 1        |
| 1        | 2        |   | 1        | 3        |

```
A ∪ B
```

| Table A ∪ B |          |
|-------------|----------|
| column 1    | column 2 |
| 1           | 1        |
| 1           | 2        |
| 1           | 3        |

#### d. Cartesian Product (✕)

→ This operation is used to merge columns from two relations.
Generally, a cartesian product is never a meaningful operation when it performs alone.
However, it becomes meaningful when it is followed by other operations. 
It is also called Cross Product or Cross Join.

| Table A  |          |   | Table B  |          |
|----------|----------|---|----------|----------|
| column 1 | column 2 |   | column 1 | column 2 |
| 1        | 1        |   | 1        | 1        |
| 1        | 2        |   | 1        | 3        |
