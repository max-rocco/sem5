### Q3a. Explain the following terms with an example.

* Natural Join (⋈)

→ Natural join does not utilize any of the comparison operators. In this type of join, the attributes should have the same name and domain. In Natural Join, there should be at least one common attribute between two relations.

→ It performs selection forming equality on those attributes which appear in both relations and eliminates the duplicate attributes.

→ Consider the following two tables

|  C  |        |  
|:---:|:------:|
| Num | Square |
|  2  |    4   |
|  3  |    9   |

|  D  |      |
|:---:|:----:|
| Num | Cube |
|  2  |   8  |
|  3  |  18  |

```
C ⋈ D
```

| C ⋈ D |        |      |
|-------|--------|------|
| Num   | Square | Cube |
| 2     | 4      | 8    |
| 3     | 9      | 18   |

* Set Intersection

→ Intersect operation is used to combine two SELECT statements, but it only retuns the records which are common from both SELECT statements. In case of Intersect the number of columns and datatype must be same.

→ Consider the following two tables.

| ID | NAME |
|----|------|
| 1  | abhi |
| 2  | adam |

| ID | NAME    |
|----|---------|
| 2  | adam    |
| 3  | Chester |

```sql
SELECT * FROM First 
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM Second;
```

| ID | NAME |
|----|------|
| 2  | adam |

* Weak Entity

→ The entity sets which do not have sufficient attributes to form a primary key are known as weak entity.

→ As the weak entities do not have any primary key, they cannot be identified on their own, so they depend on some other entity (known as owner entity).

→ The weak entities have total participation constraint (existence dependency) in its identifying relationship with owner identity. Weak entity types have partial keys. Partial Keys are set of attributes with the help of which the tuples of the weak entities can be distinguished and identified.

→ Weak entity is represented by double rectangle. The relation between one strong and one weak entity is represented by double diamond.

→ Example

In the below ER Diagram, ‘Payment’ is the weak entity. ‘Loan Payment’ is the identifying relationship and ‘Payment Number’ is the partial key. Primary Key of the Loan along with the partial key would be used to identify the records.
