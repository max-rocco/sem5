### Q1a. Differentiate between file system and database system with an example.

| S.NO. | File System                                                                                           | DBMS                                                                    |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.    | File system is a software that manages and organizes the files in a storage medium within a computer. | DBMS is a software for managing the database.                           |
| 2.    | Redundant data can be present in a file system.                                                       | In DBMS there is no redundant data.                                     |
| 3.    | It doesn‚Äôt provide backup and recovery of data if it is lost.                                         | It provides backup and recovery of data even if it is lost.             |
| 4.    | There is no efficient query processing in file system.                                                | Efficient query processing is there in DBMS.                            |
| 5.    | There is less data consistency in file system.                                                        | There is more data consistency because of the process of normalization. |
| 6.    | It is less complex as compared to DBMS.                                                               | It has more complexity in handling as compared to file system.          |
| 7.    | File systems provide less security in comparison to DBMS.                                             | DBMS has more security mechanisms as compared to file system.           |
| 8.    | It is less expensive than DBMS.                                                                       | It has a comparatively higher cost than a file system.                  |

### Q1b. Explain referential integrity with suitable example.

‚Üí Referential integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data within a relationship.

‚Üí In relationships, data is linked between two or more tables. This is achieved by having the foreign key (in the associated table) reference a primary key value (in the primary ‚Äì or parent ‚Äì table). Because of this, we need to ensure that data on both sides of the relationship remain intact.

‚Üí So, referential integrity requires that, **whenever a foreign key value is used it must reference a valid, existing primary key in the parent table.**

#### Example

‚Üí If we delete row number 15 in a primary table, we need to be sure that there‚Äôs no foreign key in any related table with the value of 15. We should only be able to delete a primary key if there are no associated rows. Otherwise, we would end up with an orphaned record.

![](https://database.guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/referential-integrity-orphaned-record.png)

‚Üí So referential integrity will prevent users from:

* Adding rows to a related table if there is no associated row in the primary table.
* Changing values in a primary table that result in orphaned records in a related table.
* Deleting rows from a primary table if there are matching related rows.

#### Consequences of a Lack of Referential Integrity

‚Üí A lack of referential integrity in a database can lead to incomplete data being returned, usually with no indication of an error. This could result in records being ‚Äúlost‚Äù in the database, because they‚Äôre never returned in queries or reports.

‚Üí It could also result in strange results appearing in reports (such as products without an associated company).
