### Q1a. Differentiate between file system and database system with an example.

| S.NO. | File System                                                                                           | DBMS                                                                    |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.    | File system is a software that manages and organizes the files in a storage medium within a computer. | DBMS is a software for managing the database.                           |
| 2.    | Redundant data can be present in a file system.                                                       | In DBMS there is no redundant data.                                     |
| 3.    | It doesn‚Äôt provide backup and recovery of data if it is lost.                                         | It provides backup and recovery of data even if it is lost.             |
| 4.    | There is no efficient query processing in file system.                                                | Efficient query processing is there in DBMS.                            |
| 5.    | There is less data consistency in file system.                                                        | There is more data consistency because of the process of normalization. |
| 6.    | It is less complex as compared to DBMS.                                                               | It has more complexity in handling as compared to file system.          |
| 7.    | File systems provide less security in comparison to DBMS.                                             | DBMS has more security mechanisms as compared to file system.           |
| 8.    | It is less expensive than DBMS.                                                                       | It has a comparatively higher cost than a file system.                  |

### Q1b. Explain referential integrity with suitable example.

‚Üí Referential integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data within a relationship.

‚Üí In relationships, data is linked between two or more tables. This is achieved by having the foreign key (in the associated table) reference a primary key value (in the primary ‚Äì or parent ‚Äì table). Because of this, we need to ensure that data on both sides of the relationship remain intact.

### Q1c. List the steps required to map ER, EER mode to relational model.
### Q1d. Explain the ACID properties of transactions.
