### Q1a. Give the advantages of memory segmentation of 8086 microprocessors.

‚Üí The advantages of segmentation are as follows:

* It provides a powerful memory management mechanism.
* Data related or stack related operations can be performed in different segments.
* Code related operation can be done in separate code segments.
* It allows to processes to easily share data.
* It allows to extend the address ability of the processor, i.e. segmentation allows the use of 16 bit registers to give an addressing capability of 1 Megabytes. Without segmentation, it would require 20 bit registers.
* It is possible to enhance the memory size of code data or stack segments beyond 64 KB by allotting more than one segment for each area.

### Q1c. Explain VM, RF, IOPL, NT flags of 80386 microprocessor.

* **RF:** Used in Intel 80x86
* **TF:** It is used for single-step control. It allows user to execute one instruction of a program at a time for debugging. When TF is set to 1, a program can be run in single-step mode. When an interrupt is recognized, the TF flag is automatically cleared. When the CPU returns back to the main program after executing interrupt service subroutine, the TF flag is restored to the state in which it was before the interrupt occurred. This is achieved by executing IRET instruction at the end of the interrupt service subroutine. There is no instruction to set or reset TF flag directly. So its setting or resetting can be done by pushing the flag register on the stack, taking necessary steps to change the TF bit as desired and then popping the flag register back off the stack.
* **VM:** Used to switch to virtual 8086 emulation. Used in Intel 80x86.
* **NT:** Used in Intel 80x86.
* **IOPL:** Used to control access to I/O instructions and hardware. Two bits. Used in Intel 80x86.

### Q1d. Explain an instruction issue algorithm of Pentium processor.

* The Pentium has superscalar organizations. It enables 2-instructions to be executed in parallel. Figure below (a) shows that the resources for address generation and ALU functions have been replicated in independent integer pipeline, called U- and V-.

* The P in the PF and D1 stages can fetch and decode 2-simple instructions in parallel and issue them to the U- and V-pipelines. Additionally, the P for complex instructions in D1 can generate micro coded sequences that control both U- and V-pipelines. Several techniques are used to resolve dependencies between instructions that might be executed in parallel.

#### Resource Dependency

When 2-instructions require a single functional unit or data path, a resource dependency occurs. The P during the D1 stage issues 2-instructions for parallel execution if both belong to the class of simple instructions, thereby eliminating most resource dependencies. The instructions must be directly executed that does not require micro-coded sequencing. The instruction being issued to the V-pipe can be an ALU operation, memory referencing or a jump. The instruction being issued to the U-pipe can be from the same categories or from an additional set that uses a functional unit available only in the U-pipe, such as the barrel shifter. Although, the set of instructions identified as 'simple' might seem restrictive, more than 90% of the instructions executed in the integer SPEC benchmark suite are simple.

#### Data dependencies

When one instruction writes a result that is read or written by another instruction, a data dependency occurs. Logic in D1 ensures that the source and the destination registers of the instruction issued to the V-pipe differ from the destination register of instruction issued to the U-pipe. This arrangement eliminates read-after-write (RAW) and write-after-write (WAW) dependencies. Write-after-read (WAR) dependencies need not be checked because reads occur in an earlier stage of the pipelines than writes. The design includes logic that enables instruction with certain special types of data dependency to be executed in parallel. For example, a conditional branch instruction that tests the flag results can be executed in parallel with a compare instruction that sets the flags.

#### Control dependencies

When the result of one instruction determines whether another instruction will be executed, a control dependency occurs. The ????P in D1 never issues an instruction to the V-pipe when a jump instruction is issued to the U-pipe, thereby eliminating control dependencies.
