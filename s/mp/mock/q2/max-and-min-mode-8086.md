### Q. Explain maximum & minimum mode of 8086 configuration with diagram.

‚Üí **Minimum mode**

* The microprocessor 8086 is operated in minimum mode by strapping its MN/MX pin to logic 1.
* In this mode, all the control signals are given out by the microprocessor chip itself. There is a single microprocessor in the minimum mode system.
* The remaining components in the system are latches, transreceivers, clock generator, memory and I/O devices.
* Latches are generally buffered output D-type flip-flops like 74LS373 or 8282.
They are used for separating the valid address from the multiplexed address/data signals and are controlled by the ALE signal generated by 8086.

* Transreceivers are the bidirectional buffers and some times they are
called as data amplifiers. They are required to separate the valid data
from the time multiplexed address/data signals. They are controlled by
two signals namely, DEN and DT/R.
* The DEN signal indicates the direction of data, i.e. from or to the
processor.
* The system contains memory for the monitor and users program
storage. Usually, EPROM are used for monitor storage, while RAM for
users program storage. A system may contain I/O devices.
* The opcode fetch and read cycles are similar. Hence the timing
diagram can be categorized in two parts, the first is the timing diagram
for read cycle and the second is the timing diagram for write cycle.
* The read cycle begins in T1 with the assertion of address latch enable
(ALE) signal and also M / IO signal. During the negative going edge of
this signal, the valid address is latched on the local bus.
The BHE and A0 signals address low, high or both bytes. From
T1 to T4 , the M/IO signal indicates a memory or I/O
operation.
* At T2, the address is removed from the local bus and is sent to
the output. The bus is then tristated. The read (RD) control
signal is also activated in T2.
* The read (RD) signal causes the address device to enable its data
bus drivers. After RD goes low, the valid data is available on the
data bus.
* The addressed device will drive the READY line high. When the
processor returns the read signal to high level, the addressed
device will again tristate its bus drivers.

‚Üí **Maximum Mode**

In the maximum mode, the 8086 is operated by strapping the
MN/MX pin to ground.
* In this mode, the processor derives the status signal S2, S1, S0.
Another chip called bus controller derives the control signal using
this status information .
* In the maximum mode, there may be more than one
microprocessor in the system configuration. The components in
the system are same as in the minimum mode system.
* The basic function of the bus controller chip IC8288, is to derive
control signals like RD and WR ( for memory and I/O devices),
DEN, DT/R, ALE etc. using the information by the processor on the
status lines.
The bus controller chip has input lines S2, S1, S0 and CLK.
These inputs to 8288 are driven by CPU.
* It derives the outputs ALE, DEN, DT/R, MRDC, MWTC,
AMWC, IORC, IOWC and AIOWC. The AEN, IOB and CEN
pins are specially useful for multiprocessor systems.
* AEN and IOB are generally grounded. CEN pin is usually tied to
+5V. The significance of the MCE/PDEN output depends upon
the status of the IOB pin.
* INTA pin used to issue two interrupt acknowledge pulses to the
interrupt controller or to an interrupting device.
* Here the only difference between in timing diagram between
minimum mode and maximum mode is the status signals used
and the available control and advanced command signals.

* R0, S1, S2 are set at the beginning of bus cycle.8288 bus controller will
output a pulse as on the ALE and apply a required signal to its DT / R
pin during T1.
* In T2, 8288 will set DEN=1 thus enabling transceivers, and for an input
it will activate MRDC or IORC. These signals are activated until T4.
* For an output, the AMWC or AIOWC is activated from T2 to T4 and
MWTC or IOWC is activated from T3 to T4.
* The status bit S0 to S2 remains active until T3 and become passive
during T3 and T4.
* If reader input is not activated before T3, wait state will be inserted
between T3 and T4.
