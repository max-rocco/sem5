#### Q3A. Galleries keep information about artists, their names (which are unique), birthplaces, age, and style of art. 
For each piece of artwork, the artist, the year it was made, its unique title, 
its type of art (e.g., painting, lithograph, sculpture, photograph), 
and its price must be stored. Pieces of artwork are also classified into groups of various kinds, 
for example, portraits, still lifes, works by Picasso, or works of the 19th century; 
a given piece may belong to more than one group. 
Each group is identified by a name (like those just given) that describes the group. 
Finally, galleries keep information about customers. 
For each customer, galleries keep that person‚Äôs unique name, address, total amount of dollars 
spent in the gallery (very important!), and the artists and groups of art that the customer tends 
to like.

‚Üí Draw the ER/EER diagram for the database.

‚Üí Write SQL statements to create the corresponding relations to the ER diagram you designed for Exercise.

```sql
-- SERVER USED: PostgreSQL 12

-- Address table
CREATE TABLE Address (
  HouseNumber INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Locality VARCHAR(128),
  City VARCHAR(128),
  State VARCHAR(128)
);

-- Customer table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
  Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  PaymentInDollars INT,
  HouseNumber INT,
  Likes INT,
  foreign key(HouseNumber) REFERENCES Address(HouseNumber) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  foreign key(Likes) REFERENCES Group(GroupID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Artist table
CREATE TABLE Artist (
  Name VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
  PhoneNumber int4,
  DateOfBirth DATE,
  Age INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (datediff(day, DateOfBirth, GETdate()) / 365.2425),
  BirthPlace VARCHAR(128),
  PaintingStyles VARCHAR(64),
  foreign key(PaintingStyles) REFERENCES Artwork(Type)
);

-- Artwork table
CREATE TABLE Artwork (
    Title VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    YearOfWork DATE NOT NULL,
    Price INT4 NOT NULL,
    Type VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    GroupID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(GroupID) REFERENCES Group(GroupID)
);

-- Group table
CREATE TABLE Group (
    GroupID PRIMARY KEY,
    GroupName VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
);

#### Q3B. Consider the following relation

```
Shipping(Shipname, Shiptype,Voyageid, Cargo, Port, Date)

With following FD

Shipname ‚Üí Shiptype
Voyageid ‚Üí Shipname, Cargo
Shipname, Date ‚Üí Voyageid, Port
```

i) Find candidate key  
ii) Normalize to 2NF  
iii) Normalize to 3NF  
iv) Normalize to BCNF
