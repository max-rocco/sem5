### Q5a. For the schema mentioned below:

```
Employee(eid, ename, address, city)

Works(eid, cid, salary)

Company(cid, cname, city)
```

Create an ER Diagram.

Specify SQL queries for each of the statements given below.

i. Modify database so that John now lives in Mumbai, assuming the database entry has John staying in Delhi.

```sql
UPDATE Employee
SET city = 'Mumbai'
WHERE ename = 'John';
```

ii. Find employees who live in the same city as the company which they work for.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Works w
ON e.eid = w.eid
INNER JOIN Company c
ON w.cid = c.cid;
```

iii. Give all employees of `AZ Corporation` whose salary has increased by 15% in the year 2018-19.

### Q5b. Define the term Normalization as used in Database design. Explain the various normal forms with examples.

* Database Normalization is a technique of organizing the data in the database. Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy(repetition) and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form, removing duplicated data from the relation tables.

* Normalization is used for mainly two purposes,

  * Eliminating redundant(useless) data.
  * Ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e data is logically stored.

* **Problems without normalization**

  * If a table is not properly normalized and have data redundancy then it will not only eat up extra memory space but will also make it difficult to handle and update the database, without facing data loss. Insertion, Updation and Deletion Anomalies are very frequent if database is not normalized. To understand these anomalies let us take an example of a Student table.

  * ![](https://i.imgur.com/JL7fWdR.png)

  * In the table above, we have data of 4 Computer Sci. students. As we can see, data for the fields branch, hod(Head of Department) and office_tel is repeated for the students who are in the same branch in the college, this is Data Redundancy.

* **Normal forms**

  * Normalization rules are divided into the following normal forms:
    1. First Normal Form
    2. Second Normal Form
    3. Third Normal Form
    4. BCNF
    5. Fourth Normal Form

  * **First Normal Form**
    * For a table to be in the First Normal Form, it should follow the following 4 rules:
       * It should only have single(atomic) valued attributes/columns.
       * Values stored in a column should be of the same domain
       * All the columns in a table should have unique names.
       * And the order in which data is stored, does not matter.

   * **Second Normal Form**
     * For a table to be in the Second Normal Form,
       * It should be in the First Normal form.
       * And, it should not have Partial Dependency.

    * **Third Normal Form**
      * A table is said to be in the Third Normal Form when,
        * It is in the Second Normal form.
        * And, it doesn't have Transitive Dependency.

     * **Boyce-Codd Normal Form**
       * Boyce and Codd Normal Form is a higher version of the Third Normal form. This form deals with certain type of anomaly that is not handled by 3NF.
         A 3NF table which does not have multiple overlapping candidate keys is said to be in BCNF.
         For a table to be in BCNF, following conditions must be satisfied:
         * R must be in 3rd Normal Form and, for each functional dependency ( X ‚Üí Y ), X should be a super Key.

     * **Fourth Normal Form**
        * A table is said to be in the Fourth Normal Form when,
          * It is in the Boyce-Codd Normal Form.
          * And, it doesn't have Multi-Valued Dependency.
