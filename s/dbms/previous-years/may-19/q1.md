### Q1a. Differentiate between file system and database system with an example.

| S.NO. | File System                                                                                           | DBMS                                                                    |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.    | File system is a software that manages and organizes the files in a storage medium within a computer. | DBMS is a software for managing the database.                           |
| 2.    | Redundant data can be present in a file system.                                                       | In DBMS there is no redundant data.                                     |
| 3.    | It doesn‚Äôt provide backup and recovery of data if it is lost.                                         | It provides backup and recovery of data even if it is lost.             |
| 4.    | There is no efficient query processing in file system.                                                | Efficient query processing is there in DBMS.                            |
| 5.    | There is less data consistency in file system.                                                        | There is more data consistency because of the process of normalization. |
| 6.    | It is less complex as compared to DBMS.                                                               | It has more complexity in handling as compared to file system.          |
| 7.    | File systems provide less security in comparison to DBMS.                                             | DBMS has more security mechanisms as compared to file system.           |
| 8.    | It is less expensive than DBMS.                                                                       | It has a comparatively higher cost than a file system.                  |

### Q1b. Explain referential integrity with suitable example.

‚Üí Referential integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data within a relationship.

‚Üí In relationships, data is linked between two or more tables. This is achieved by having the foreign key (in the associated table) reference a primary key value (in the primary ‚Äì or parent ‚Äì table). Because of this, we need to ensure that data on both sides of the relationship remain intact.

‚Üí So, referential integrity requires that, **whenever a foreign key value is used it must reference a valid, existing primary key in the parent table.**

#### Example

‚Üí If we delete row number 15 in a primary table, we need to be sure that there‚Äôs no foreign key in any related table with the value of 15. We should only be able to delete a primary key if there are no associated rows. Otherwise, we would end up with an orphaned record.

![](https://database.guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/referential-integrity-orphaned-record.png)

‚Üí So referential integrity will prevent users from:

* Adding rows to a related table if there is no associated row in the primary table.
* Changing values in a primary table that result in orphaned records in a related table.
* Deleting rows from a primary table if there are matching related rows.

#### Consequences of a Lack of Referential Integrity

‚Üí A lack of referential integrity in a database can lead to incomplete data being returned, usually with no indication of an error. This could result in records being ‚Äúlost‚Äù in the database, because they‚Äôre never returned in queries or reports.

‚Üí It could also result in strange results appearing in reports (such as products without an associated company).

### Q1c. List the steps required to map ER, EER mode to relational model.

‚Üí ER Model, when conceptualized into diagrams, gives a good overview of entity-relationship, which is easier to understand. ER diagrams can be mapped to relational schema, that is, it is possible to create relational schema using ER diagram. We cannot import all the ER constraints into relational model, but an approximate schema can be generated.

‚Üí There are several processes and algorithms available to convert ER Diagrams into Relational Schema. We may focus here on the mapping diagram contents to relational basics.

#### 1. Mapping Entity

* Create table for each entity.
* Entity's attributes should become fields of tables with their respective data types.
* Declare primary key.

#### 2. Mapping Relationship

* Create table for a relationship.
* Add the primary keys of all participating Entities as fields of table with their respective data types.
* If relationship has any attribute, add each attribute as field of table.
* Declare a primary key composing all the primary keys of participating entities.
* Declare all foreign key constraints.

#### 3. Mapping Weak Entity Sets

* Create table for weak entity set.
* Add all its attributes to table as field.
* Add the primary key of identifying entity set.
* Declare all foreign key constraints.

#### 4. Mapping Hierarchical Entities

* Create tables for all higher-level entities.
* Create tables for lower-level entities.
* Add primary keys of higher-level entities in the table of lower-level entities.
* In lower-level tables, add all other attributes of lower-level entities.
* Declare primary key of higher-level table and the primary key for lower-level table.
* Declare foreign key constraints.

### Q1d. Explain the ACID properties of transactions.

‚Üí A transaction is a single logical unit of work which accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database. Transactions access data using read and write operations.

‚Üí In order to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the transaction, certain properties are followed. These are called ACID properties.

#### Atomicity

‚Üí By this, we mean that either the entire transaction takes place at once or doesn‚Äôt happen at all. There is no midway i.e. transactions do not occur partially. Each transaction is considered as one unit and either runs to completion or is not executed at all. It involves the following two operations.

  * Abort: If a transaction aborts, changes made to database are not visible.  
  * Commit: If a transaction commits, changes made are visible.

#### Consistency

‚Üí This means that integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction. It refers to the correctness of a database.

#### Isolation

‚Üí This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency of database state. Transactions occur independently without interference. Changes occurring in a particular transaction will not be visible to any other transaction until that particular change in that transaction is written to memory or has been committed.

‚Üí This property ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently will result in a state that is equivalent to a state achieved these were executed serially in some order.

#### Durability

‚Üí This property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs. These updates now become permanent and are stored in non-volatile memory. The effects of the transaction, thus, are never lost.
