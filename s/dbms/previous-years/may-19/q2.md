### Q2a. Explain the following Relational Algebra operations with suitable example.

‚Üí The following table will be used in the examples.

| CustomerID | CustomerName | Status   |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| 1          | Google       | Active   |
| 2          | Amazon       | Active   |
| 3          | Apple        | Inactive |
| 4          | Alibaba      | Active   |

#### a. Projection (œÄ)

‚Üí Projection eliminates all but those mentioned in the projection list.
The projection method defines a relation that contains a vertical subset of relation.

‚Üí This helps to extract the values of specified attributes to eliminate duplicate values.

‚Üí œÄ (pi) is used to choose attributes from a relation.
This operator helps you keep specific columns from a relation and discard other columns.

```
œÄ CustomerName, Status (Customers)
```

‚Üí Here, the projection of CustomerName & Status will give the following result.

| CustomerName | Status   |
|--------------|----------|
| Google       | Active   |
| Amazon       | Active   |
| Apple        | Inactive |
| Alibaba      | Active   |

#### b. Select (œÉ)

‚Üí The SELECT operation is used for selecting a subset of the tuples according to a given
selection condition.

‚Üí œÉ (Sigma) symbol is used to denote this relation.
It is used as an expression to choose tuples which meet the selection condition.
Select operator selects tuples that satisfy a given predicate.

```
œÉ CustomerName = "Amazon" and Status = "Active"
```

‚Üí Here, the selection of `CustomerName = "Amazon"` & `Status = "Active"` will give the following
result.

| CustomerName | Status   |
|--------------|----------|
| Amazon       | Active   |

#### c. Union (‚à™)

‚Üí This is a binary operation & will include all the tuples from both the tables.
It also eliminates duplicate tuples.

‚Üí For a union operation to be valid, the following conditions must hold:

* Both tables must have the same number of attributes.
* Attribute domains need to be compatible.
* Duplicate tuples should be automatically removed.

| Table A  |          |   | Table B  |          |
|----------|----------|---|----------|----------|
| column 1 | column 2 |   | column 1 | column 2 |
| 1        | 1        |   | 1        | 1        |
| 1        | 2        |   | 1        | 3        |

```
A ‚à™ B
```

| Table A ‚à™ B |          |
|-------------|----------|
| column 1    | column 2 |
| 1           | 1        |
| 1           | 2        |
| 1           | 3        |

#### d. Cartesian Product (‚úï)

‚Üí This operation is used to merge columns from two relations.
Generally, a cartesian product is never a meaningful operation when it performs alone.
However, it becomes meaningful when it is followed by other operations.
It is also called Cross Product or Cross Join.

| Table A  |          |   | Table B  |          |
|----------|----------|---|----------|----------|
| column 1 | column 2 |   | column 1 | column 2 |
| 1        | 1        |   | 1        | 1        |
| 1        | 2        |   | 1        | 3        |

### Q2b. Construct ER diagram and convert into Relational Model for a Library Management System. Specify 2 complex SQL queries using GROUP BY & JOIN operation with an example.

#### ER Diagram

#### Entities & their attributes

* **Book Entity:** It has authno, isbn number, title, edition, category, price. ISBN is the Primary Key for Book Entity.
* **Reader Entity:** It has UserId, Email, address, phone no, name. Name is composite attribute of firstname and lastname. Phone no is multi valued attribute. UserId is the Primary Key for Readers entity.
* **Publisher Entity:** It has PublisherId, Year of publication, name. PublisherID is the Primary Key.
* **Authentication System Entity:** It has LoginId and password with LoginID as Primary Key.
* **Reports Entity:** It has UserId, Reg_no, Book_no, Issue/Return date. Reg_no is the Primary Key of reports entity.
* **Staff Entity:** It has name and staff_id with staff_id as Primary Key.
* **Reserve/Return Relationship Set:** It has three attributes: Reserve date, Due date, Return date.

#### Relationships between entities

* A reader can reserve N books but one book can be reserved by only one reader.
The relationship 1:N.
* A publisher can publish many books but a book is published by only one publisher.
The relationship 1:N.
* Staff keeps track of readers. The relationship is M:N.
* Staff maintains multiple reports. The relationship 1:N.
* Staff maintains multiple Books. The relationship 1:N.
* Authentication system provides login to multiple staffs. The relation is 1:N.
