a) DB     1) used to direct the assembler to reserve only 10-bytes
b) DT     2) used to direct the assembler to reserve only 4 words
c) DW     3) used to direct the assembler to reserve byte or bytes
d) DQ     4) used to direct the assembler to reserve words

```

* [ ] a-3, b-2, c-4, d-1
* [ ] a-2, b-3, c-1, d-4
* [ ] a-3, b-1, c-2, d-4
* [x] a-3, b-1, c-4, d-2
