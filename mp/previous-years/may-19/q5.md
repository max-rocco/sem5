### Q5a. Explain different addressing modes of 8086 processor.

‚áÄ The way of specifying data to be operated by an instruction is known as addressing modes. 
This specifies that the given data is an immediate data or an address. 
It also specifies whether the given operand is register or register pair.

‚áÄ Types of addressing modes are as follows:

1. **Register Mode** ‚Äî In this type of addressing mode both the operands are registers.

```asm
MOV AX, BX
XOR AX, DX
ADD AL, BL
```

2. **Immediate Mode** ‚Äî In this type of addressing mode the source operand is a 8 bit or 16 bit data. 
Destination operand can never be immediate data.

```asm
MOV AX, 2000
MOV CL, 0A
ADD AL, 45
AND AX, 0000
MOV AX, 2000
MOV CS, AX
```

3. **Displacement or Direct Mode** ‚Äî In this type of addressing mode the effective address is 
directly given in the instruction as displacement.

```asm
MOV AX, [DISP]
MOV AX, [0500]
```

4. **Register Indirect Mode** ‚Äî In this addressing mode the effective address is in SI, DI or BX.

```asm
MOV AX, [DI]
ADD AL, [BX]
MOV AX, [SI]
```

5. **Based Indexed Mode** ‚Äî In this the effective address is sum of base register and index register.

```asm
Base register: BX, BP
Index register: SI, DI
MOV AL, [BP+SI]
MOV AX, [BX+DI]
```

6. **Indexed Mode** ‚Äî In this type of addressing mode the effective address is sum of 
index register and displacement.

```asm
MOV AX, [SI+2000]
MOV AL, [DI+3000]
```

7. **Based Mode** ‚Äî In this the effective address is the sum of base register and displacement.

```asm
MOV AL, [BP+ 0100]
```

8. **Based Indexed Displacement Mode** ‚Äî In this type of addressing mode the effective address is 
the sum of index register, base register and displacement.

```asm
MOV AL, [SI+BP+2000] 
```

9. **String Mode** ‚Äî This addressing mode is related to string instructions. 
In this the value of SI and DI are auto incremented and decremented depending 
upon the value of directional flag.

```asm
MOVS B
MOVS W
```

10. **Input / Output Mode** ‚Äî This addressing mode is related with input output operations.

```asm
IN A, 45
OUT A, 50
```

11. **Relative Mode** ‚Äî In this the effective address is calculated with reference to 
instruction pointer.

```asm
JNZ 8 bit address
IP=IP+8 bit address
```

### Q5b. Explain the operation of three 8259 PIC in cascaded mode.

1. When more than one 8259s are connected to the microprocessor, it is called as a cascaded configuration.
2. A cascaded configuration increases the number of interrupts handled by the system.
3. As the maximum number of 8259s interfaced can be 9 (1 master and 8 slaves) the maximum number of interrupts handled can be 64.
4. Each slave‚Äôs INT output is connected to the IR input of the master.
5. The INT output of the master is connected to the INTR input of the microprocessor.
6. The master addresses the individual slaves through CAS2, CAS1 and CAS0 lines connected from the master to each of the slaves.
7. First the INTR signal of the microprocessor should be enabled using the STI instruction.
8. Each 8259 (master or slave) has its own address and has to be initialized separately by giving ICWs as per requirement.
9. When an interrupt request occurs on a slave, the events are performed:
10. The slave 8259 resolves the priority of the interrupt and sends the interrupt to the master 8259.
11. The master resolves the priority among the slaves and sends the interrupt to the microprocessor.
12. The microprocessor pushes the contents of flag register, CS, IP in to the stack; clears IF and TF and transfers program to the address of the ISR.
13. The ISR thus begins.
