### Q3a. (i) Write a short note on mixed language programming.

* There are times when programs need to call programs written in other languages referred as mixed language programming. For example, when a particular subprogram is available in a language other than language you are using, or when algorithms are described more naturally in a different language, you need to use more than one language.

* Mixed-language programming always involves a call to a function, procedure, or subroutine. Mixed-language calls involve calling functions in separate modules. Instead of compiling all source programs with same compiler, different compilers or assemblers are used as per the language used in the programs.

* Microsoft C supports this mixed language programming. So it can combine assembly code routines in C as a separate language.

* C program calls assembly language routines that are separately assembled by-MASM (MASM Assembler). These assembled modules are linked with the compiled C modules to get executable file. Fig shows the compile, assemble and link processes using C compiler, MASM assembler, and TUNIC.

### Q3a. (ii) Write a program to find the largest number from array.

‚Üí Sourced from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47265977).

```asm
[org 0x0100]
jmp start

array_nums: dw 19, 50, 30, 24, 19, 2, 5, 6, 40, 8, 23, 16, 17, 28, 86

; ----------------------------------------------------------
; find the largest value in an array of ints
; in-params:
;   CX = number of values in array
;   BX = pointer to array
; out-params
;    AX = biggest value

findBiggest:
            mov ax, [bx]     ; first number to ax
            mov cx, 15

maxvalue:   cmp ax, [bx]     ; find the maximun number
            jge maxloop      ; if greater or equal number
            mov ax, [bx]     ; maximum number was larger
maxloop:
            add bx, 2        ; advance bx to next index
            loop maxvalue
            ret
; ----------------------------------------------------------

 start:     mov bx, offset array_nums     ; use find function on 'array_nums'
            mov cx, 15
            call findBiggest

            ; add some code here to show a
            ; message if AX is what you expected or not
            ; AX should be 86 for the example array    

            mov ax, 0x4c00              ; terminate program
            int 0x21
