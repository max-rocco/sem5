### Q1a. Give the advantages of memory segmentation of 8086 microprocessors.

‚Üí The advantages of segmentation are as follows:

* It provides a powerful memory management mechanism.
* Data related or stack related operations can be performed in different segments.
* Code related operation can be done in separate code segments.
* It allows to processes to easily share data.
* It allows to extend the address ability of the processor, i.e. segmentation allows the use of 16 bit registers to give an addressing capability of 1 Megabytes. Without segmentation, it would require 20 bit registers.
* It is possible to enhance the memory size of code data or stack segments beyond 64 KB by allotting more than one segment for each area.

### Q1b. Differentiate procedure & macro with example.

| S.No. | MACRO                                                                                                                | PROCEDURE                                                                                                               |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01.   | Macro definition contains a set of instruction to support modular programming.                                       | Procedure contains a set of instructions which can be called repetitively which can perform a specific task.            |
| 02.   | It is used for small set of instructions mostly less than ten instructions.                                          | It is used for large set of instructions mostly more than ten instructions.                                             |
| 03.   | In case of macro memory requirement is high.                                                                         | In case of procedure memory requirement is less.                                                                        |
| 04.   | CALL and RET instruction/statements are not required in macro.                                                       | CALL and RET instruction/statements are required in procedure.                                                          |
| 05.   | Assembler directive MACRO is used to define macro and assembler directive ENDM is used to indicate the body is over. | Assembler directive PROC is used to define procedure and assembler directive ENDP is used to indicate the body is over. |
| 06.   | Execution time of macro is less as it executes faster than procedure.                                                | Execution time of procedures is high as it executes slower than macro.                                                  |
| 07.   | Here machine code is created multiple times as each time machine code is generated when macro is called.             | Here machine code is created only once, it is generated only once when the procedure is defined.                        |
| 08.   | In a macro parameter is passed as part of statement that calls macro.                                                | In a procedure parameters are passed in registers and memory locations of stack.                                        |
| 09.   | Overhead time does not take place as there is no calling and returning.                                              | Overhead time takes place during calling procedure and returning control to calling program                             |
