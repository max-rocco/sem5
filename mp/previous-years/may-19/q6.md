### Q6a. Draw and explain memory read & memory write machine cycle timing diagrams in maximum mode of 8086.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jyhSy2L.webp)

* It is a multiprocessor mode. 
Along with 8086, there can be other processors like 8087 and 8089 in the circuit. 
Here MN/¬ØMX is connected to ground itself.
* Since, there are multiple processors; ALE for the latch is given by 8288 bus controller. 
Instead of 8086 control signals are generated by bus controller 8288 using special decoding 
of status pins ¬Ø(S0,) ¬Ø(S1,) ¬ØS2.

* Since 8288 independently generates control signals, it needs a CLK from 8284 clock generator.

### Q6b. Explain the following:

i) Types of interrupts.

* Interrupt is the method of creating a temporary halt during program execution and allows 
peripheral devices to access the microprocessor. 
The microprocessor responds to that interrupt with an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine), 
which is a short program to instruct the microprocessor on how to handle the interrupt.

#### Hardware Interrupts

* Hardware interrupt is caused by any peripheral device by sending a signal through a 
specified pin to the microprocessor.
* The 8086 has two hardware interrupt pins, i.e. NMI and INTR. 
NMI is a non-maskable interrupt and INTR is a maskable interrupt having lower priority. 
One more interrupt pin associated is INTA called interrupt acknowledge.

#### NMI

* It is a single non-maskable interrupt pin (NMI) having higher priority than the maskable 
interrupt request pin (INTR) and it is of type 2 interrupt.

#### INTR

* The INTR is a maskable interrupt because the microprocessor will be interrupted only if 
interrupts are enabled using set interrupt flag instruction. 
It should not be enabled using clear interrupt Flag instruction.
* The INTR interrupt is activated by an I/O port. 
If the interrupt is enabled and NMI is disabled, then the microprocessor first completes 
the current execution and sends ‚Äò0‚Äô on INTA pin twice. 
The first ‚Äò0‚Äô means INTA informs the external device to get ready and during the second 
‚Äò0‚Äô the microprocessor receives the 8 bit, say X, from the programmable interrupt controller.

#### ii) Modes of 8253 Programmable Interval Timer.

#### Mode 0 ‚îÄ Interrupt on Terminal Count

* It is used to generate an interrupt to the microprocessor after a certain interval.
* Initially the output is low after the mode is set. The output remains LOW after the count value is loaded into the counter.
* The process of decrementing the counter continues till the terminal count is reached, i.e., the count become zero and the output goes HIGH and will remain high until it reloads a new count.
* The GATE signal is high for normal counting. When GATE goes low, counting is terminated and the current count is latched till the GATE goes high again.

#### Mode 1 ‚Äì Programmable One Shot

* It can be used as a mono stable multi-vibrator.
* The gate input is used as a trigger input in this mode.
* The output remains high until the count is loaded and a trigger is applied.

#### Mode 2 ‚Äì Rate Generator

* The output is normally high after initialization.
* Whenever the count becomes zero, another low pulse is generated at the output and 
the counter will be reloaded.

#### Mode 3 ‚Äì Square Wave Generator

* This mode is similar to Mode 2 except the output remains low for half of the timer period and high for the other half of the period.

#### Mode 4 ‚àí Software Triggered Mode

* In this mode, the output will remain high until the timer has counted to zero, at which point the output will pulse low and then go high again.
* The count is latched when the GATE signal goes LOW.
* On the terminal count, the output goes low for one clock cycle then goes HIGH. This low pulse can be used as a strobe.

#### Mode 5 ‚Äì Hardware Triggered Mode

* This mode generates a strobe in response to an externally generated signal.
* This mode is similar to mode 4 except that the counting is initiated by a signal at the gate input, which means it is hardware triggered instead of software triggered.
* After it is initialized, the output goes high.
* When the terminal count is reached, the output goes low for one clock cycle.
