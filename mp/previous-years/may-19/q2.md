### Q2a. Explain minimum mode configuration of 8086 microprocessor.

* 8086 works in Minimum Mode, when MN/ ¯MX = 1.
* Minimum Mode, 8086 is the only processor in the system.
* Clock is provided by the 8284 clock generator, it provides CLK, RESET and READY input to 8086.
* Address from the address bus is latched into 8282 8-bit latch. 
Three such latches are needed, as address bus is 20-bit. 
The ALE of 8086 is connected to STB of the latch. 
The ALE for this latch is given by 8086 itself.
* The data bus is driven through 8286 8-bit trans-receiver. 
Two such trans-receivers are needed, as the data bus is 16-bit. 
The trans-receivers are enabled through the DEN signal, while the direction of data 
is controlled by the DT/ ¯R signal. 
¯DEN is connected to ¯OE and DT/ ¯R is connected to T. 
Both ¯DEN and DT/ ¯R are given by 8086 itself.

* Control signals for all operations are generated by decoding M/¯IO , ¯RD and ¯WR signals.

* M/¯IO , ¯RD and ¯WR are decoded by a 3:8 decoder like IC 74138. 
Bus Request (DMA) is done using the HOLD and HLDA signals.
* ¯INTA is given by 8086, in response to an interrupt on INTR line.

### Q2b. Explain the cache organization of Pentium processor.

* Despite the potential advantages of a unified cache which is used in the 80486 processor, the Pentium microprocessor uses separate code and data caches.
* The reason is that the superscalar design and branch prediction demand more bandwidth than a unified cache.
* First, efficient branch prediction requires that the destination of a branch be accessed simultaneously with data references of previous instructions executing in the pipeline.
* Second, the parallel execution of data memory references requires simultaneous accesses for loads and stores.
* Third, in the context of the overall Pentium microprocessor design, handling self-modifying code for separate code and data caches is only marginally more complex than for a unified cache.
* The data and instruction caches on the Pentium processor are each 8 KB, two-way associative designs with 32 byte lines. Each cache has a dedicated translation lookaside Buffer (TLB) to translate linear addresses to physical addresses.
* The caches can be enabled or disabled by software or hardware. The Pentium microprocessor implements the data cache to supports dual accesses by the U-pipe and V-pipe to provide additional bandwidth and simplify compiler instruction scheduling algorithms.
* The data cache is write back or write through configured on a line-by-line basis and follows the MESI protocol. The data cache tags arc triple ported to support two data transfers and an inquire cycle in the same clock.
* The code cache is an inherent write protected cache. The code cache tags of the Pentium processor are also triple ported to support snooping and split-line accesses.
* The data path, however, is single ported with eight way interleaving of 32-bit-wide banks. When a bank conflict occurs, the U-pipe assumes software or hardware.
