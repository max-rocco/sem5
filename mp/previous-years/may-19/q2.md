### Q2a. Explain minimum mode configuration of 8086 microprocessor.

* 8086 works in Minimum Mode, when MN/ ¯MX = 1.
* Minimum Mode, 8086 is the only processor in the system.
* Clock is provided by the 8284 clock generator, it provides CLK, RESET and READY input to 8086.
* Address from the address bus is latched into 8282 8-bit latch. 
Three such latches are needed, as address bus is 20-bit. 
The ALE of 8086 is connected to STB of the latch. 
The ALE for this latch is given by 8086 itself.
* The data bus is driven through 8286 8-bit trans-receiver. 
Two such trans-receivers are needed, as the data bus is 16-bit. 
The trans-receivers are enabled through the DEN signal, while the direction of data 
is controlled by the DT/ ¯R signal. 
¯DEN is connected to ¯OE and DT/ ¯R is connected to T. 
Both ¯DEN and DT/ ¯R are given by 8086 itself.

* Control signals for all operations are generated by decoding M/¯IO , ¯RD and ¯WR signals.

* M/¯IO , ¯RD and ¯WR are decoded by a 3:8 decoder like IC 74138. 
Bus Request (DMA) is done using the HOLD and HLDA signals.
* ¯INTA is given by 8086, in response to an interrupt on INTR line.
